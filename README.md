# char-boltzmann

Character-level RBMs for short text

# How-to

`train.py` trains an RBM model on a text file with one short text per line. `data/getnames.sh` grabs a text file with given names, which is a fine example. 

`sample.py` generates new short texts given a pickled model file generated by `train.py`. `visualize.py` generates some html visualizations of what a model is doing.

More details on the arguments to these scripts can be seen by running them with '-h'.

# Requirements

scikit-learn and its dependencies (numpy, scipy). Probably some other stuff that I've forgotten.
